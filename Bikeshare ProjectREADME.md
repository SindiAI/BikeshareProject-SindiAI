# Masterschool-SindiAI

This repository contains a bikeshare project that utilizes Python to create an interactive program
that displays descriptive statistics on bike usage in three major cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington.

## Getting Started

Toget started with the project, you will need to have Python installed on your local machine. [You can download Python from the official website:](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git

## Running the Program

To run the program, open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:
python bikeshare.py

The program will prompt you to enter the city you want to analyze data for, as well as the time period you want to view statistics for. 
After making your selections, the program will display a series of descriptive statistics on bike usage for the chosen city and time period.

## Data Sources 

The data used in this project was provided by Motivate, 
a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, including Chicago, New York, and Washington.
